# 🧠 PeerPrep

PeerPrep is an intelligent, real-time, peer-to-peer DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice platform inspired by matchmaking apps like Bumble. It’s designed to make coding practice social, adaptive, and growth-focused.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔗 Real-Time Matchmaking: Users are instantly paired with others in a similar skill bracket (Rating: 100 – 3000).

- 📹 Private Live Sessions: Get a unique meet link for each session, enabling real-time video communication and collaborative coding.

- 💻 Shared Coding Editor: Write, compile, and debug together in a shared space.

- 🧠 AI-Generated DSA Problems: Each pair receives a custom-generated DSA problem tailored to their combined skill level.

- 📊 Smart Rating System: After the session, PeerPrep evaluates:
  - Solution correctness and efficiency
  - Time taken
  - Collaboration dynamics
  
  and updates each user’s rating accordingly to ensure fair matchmaking and continuous learning.

- 🏆 Gamified Learning: Progress through ratings, track improvements, and build motivation with a system that values growth.

- 🤝 Community Focused: Practice isn't just about solving — it’s about learning together.

## 🎯 Why PeerPrep?

Most platforms focus on solo grinding. PeerPrep brings human connection to the learning process by helping users:

Overcome hesitation in interviews and live coding rounds.
Collaborate, communicate, and learn from peers.
Experience a fun, engaging way to master DSA topics.
